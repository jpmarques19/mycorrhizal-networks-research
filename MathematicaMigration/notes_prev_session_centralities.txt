This project folder contains work related to network analysis using the NetworkX library in Python. Specifically, this session focused on calculating various centrality measures for nodes in a graph, including degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and eccentricity centrality.

The networkx library was used to create a graph and calculate the centrality measures. The results were stored in Python dictionaries and converted to pandas DataFrames for export to CSV files.

In addition, a question was asked about the definition of eccentricity centrality, and it was clarified that the eccentricity centrality of a node can be calculated as the inverse of its eccentricity value.

Next time, we need to compare the centralities of the two networks.

1.Load the centrality measures of the previous network from CSV files.
2.Calculate the differences between the centrality measures of both networks.
3.Create a summary table or visualization to show the differences.
4.Write a brief analysis of the comparison results.
5.Share the comparison summary and analysis with your supervisor via email or a collaborative document.
