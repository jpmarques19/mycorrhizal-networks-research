Research Topic: Overlapping community Structure in MN's
Focus point: Compare ground truth comunities with detected communities
Research question: How will community detection methods perform in the context of MN's?

Based on your research topic, focus point, and research question, here are some suggested objectives and an appropriate research design:

Objectives:

1. To review and evaluate existing community detection methods for their suitability in the context of MN's (Multilayer Networks).
2. To identify ground truth communities within selected real-world MN's.
3. To apply community detection methods to the selected MN's and compare the detected communities with the ground truth communities.
4. To quantify the performance of community detection methods using appropriate evaluation metrics.
5. To investigate the factors affecting the performance of community detection methods in the context of MN's, such as network size, density, and interlayer connections.
