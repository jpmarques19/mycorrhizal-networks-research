This article serves as an excellent foundation for an introduction, providing valuable references and introducing essential concepts and terminology for studying community structure analysis and overlap. It also offers useful ideas for a statistical approach to the study.

The article highlights the limited attention given to analyzing community structure in complex networks. It examines an overlapping community network derived from a large-scale co-authorship network, in which nodes symbolize functional communities and links represent shared nodes between communities. The analysis shows that the two networks share similar topological properties, suggesting that the overlapping community network effectively represents the original co-authorship network, and its smaller size may be more practical for various analyses.

The paper discusses real-world complex networks that share common topological properties. Community structures in these networks are crucial for understanding their structural and functional aspects. While numerous community detection algorithms exist, they generally assume nodes belong to either non-overlapping or overlapping communities. Overlapping community structures are especially relevant in social networks, where individuals belong to multiple communities.

Despite extensive work on community detection, few studies have focused on analyzing overlapping community structures. Palla et al.'s influential work introduced four basic quantities for characterizing networks with overlapping communities and used a clique percolation community detection algorithm to identify communities. However, these studies have limitations, such as dependency on community detection algorithms and relatively small network sizes.

The present work addresses these limitations by employing a large-scale network with ground truth community structure to analyze overlapping community networks. The objective is to investigate the relationship between the original co-authorship network and its overlapping network of communities. The paper is organized into sections discussing the background, analysis results, and conclusions.
