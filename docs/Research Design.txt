Research Design:

1. Literature Review: Conduct a thorough literature review to identify existing community detection methods and their applications in the context of MN's. Analyze the strengths and limitations of each method in relation to your research question.

2. Data Collection: Select real-world MN's for your study. These networks should have known ground truth communities, which can be obtained from existing literature, domain experts, or supplementary information about the networks.

3. Preprocessing: Prepare the selected MN's for analysis by cleaning the data, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency across layers.

4. Method Selection: Choose community detection methods that are appropriate for MN's, based on your literature review and the specific characteristics of your selected networks.

5. Method Application: Apply the chosen community detection methods to the selected MN's, obtaining detected communities for each method.

6. Comparison: Compare the detected communities with the ground truth communities using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), or F1-score.

7. Analysis: Analyze the performance of each community detection method in the context of MN's, identifying factors that may affect their performance, such as network properties or method parameters.

8. Conclusion: Summarize your findings, highlighting the most effective community detection methods for MN's and any insights into the factors influencing their performance. Discuss the implications of your results for the field and suggest avenues for future research.
